Description: The 2017, 2019 and 2024 UK General Elections produced highly contrasting results. 
  It is, however, difficult to compare certain aspects of them because of boundary changes to constituencies which took effect for the 2024 election.
  This package reprojects voting data from the earlier elections to the 2024 boundaries.
